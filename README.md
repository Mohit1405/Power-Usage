# INTRODUCTION 
Understanding and controlling power use is crucial for 
cutting expenses, boosting operational efficiency, and 
improving sustainability in today's energy-conscious 
environment. Large amounts of power usage data can 
now be examined to identify consumption trends, 
forecast future demand, and identify anomalous 
activity that can point to inefficiencies or problems 
thanks to the expanding availability of smart energy meters 
and Internet of devices.
